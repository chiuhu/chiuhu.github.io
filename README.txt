I am migrating my site over to Github Pages and this is the first iteration.
I am working on this project over a couple of months and I intend to use it as 
a sort of portfolio/blog kind of website when I am done making changes to it.

I am currently using Dimension theme from HTML5 UP html5up.net. The final version 
might keep aspects of this theme but I primarily will be using Bootstrap and JS on 
the final version.
